        <h1>A Day in the Life of A Perfectionist</h1>
        <h2>Full Discloser: This isn't going to be pretty.....</h2>
        <p>
            I am a self proclaimed sloppy perfectionist. Contradictory of terms, yes? Well welcome to my constant internal push and pull! 
            From a young age, I needed to do things Just Right. Draw the perfect teddy bear, stay in the lines, glue every single, individual piece of yarn onto the paper plate lion in pre-school. It didn't matter how long it took. Recess be damned! Teachers had a love/hate relationship with me to say the least.
            It was always assumed that my parents did my projects for me. My mom wasn't very good at doing hair, so I taught myself to french braid. My talents became well known and in high school I had a lign
            of friends before school started asking for hairstyles. I was a weird girl. Still am! On the flip side, I also am a procrastinator extraordinaire, which means I demand perfection of myself and my work, then leave it too late
            and rush to get it done before it's too late! Part of this is out of necessity. If I didn't wait until the last minute, I would never get a project done- I'd just keep going.
            This struggle is real, and extends to things beyond projects. Read on, if you dare, and sneak a peak into the inner workings of my life.

        <h3>6:30am - 7:30am</h3>
        <p>
            My alarm goes off, and I immediately hit snooze. Again, and again, and again. Each time it goes off I promise myself that next time will be the time I leap out of bed full of vim and vigor after that extra 9 mins of prescious, prescious sleep. 
            Each time I don't get up, the guilt mounts. If I just get out of bed now, I'll be able to do all the things I want to in a timely, orderly fashion. Necessity is the only thing that finally gets me moving, and the guilt is at critical mass as I quickly assess
            what I realistically can fit in, and what things I need to cut. Goodbye cup of tea. Goodbye reasonable and enjoying application of make-up. Goodbye proper hair drying. Sigh.

        <h3>8:30am</h3>
        <p>
            I finally depart already crunching the numbers to see if I have time to stop at Starbucks for the missed cup of tea. I have to check, and triple check that I have everything I need before heading out the door. Inevitably, I forget something, and only manage to remember what that
            is as I am halfway downt he drive, and have to have a several second internal discussion on the merits of stopping and running inside for my wedding ring 
            and is it more important than a cup of tea at Starbucks. I remain unmarried for the day, and rush to Starbucks half of me hoping that there is a line at the drive through so that I can get a head start on emails,
            and the other half of me hoping that there isn't a line so that I can get to work on time- or dare I hope, a few minutes early. I also internally debate whether or not to get the srcummy breakfast sandwich, or stick to the plan
            and have a clean eating day. I usually end up with the sandwich. More guilt ensues.

        <h3>9am</h3>
        <p>I arrive at work, and chastize myself for not having the time to style my hair, again, and wish I had been able to find my mascara in my massive Mary Poppins hand bag, which has everything I could possibly need, but then never can find when its needed. I really should go through my bag and 
            go through my bag and get everything organized. I will feel so much better about things in general. I sit down, boot up the computer, congratulate myself for not leaving my charger at home, grumble about leaving my mouse out home, only to finally find it along with that elusive mascara I couldn't fine earlier. I give myself a pep talk, and make a lovely list 
            of all my tasks I am going to calmly and orderly do throughout the day, and attack my inbox with vim and vigor. After which, I throw out the lovely list of
